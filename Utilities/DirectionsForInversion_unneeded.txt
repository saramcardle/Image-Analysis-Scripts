## Detect cells outside of the tingible body macrophages
We're going to use InstanSeg to detect all cells other than TB Macs. To ensure that we do not accidentally detect the macrophage nuclei as if it were a new cell, we will exclude the macrophage area from the region in which we detect cells. 

1. Select all macrophage annotations: `Right click on the class name in the Annotations tab > Select objects by classification`
2. Merge them into a single object: `Right click on the image > Annotations > Edit multiple > Merge selected`

    - It will take longer than shown here! 2~5 min.
3. Make the inverse object, which is all space other than the macrophage area: `Right click on the object > Annotations > Edit single >: Make inverse`

4. The new object wil be of the None class and will be selected. Set it to the Ignore* class.

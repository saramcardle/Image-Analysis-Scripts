These are example QuPath scripts that histology core facilities can use QuPath to automate quality control checks, as described by Zbigniew Mikulski at QBI 2019, Rennes, France. 

StainingQC checks for changes in intensity in hematoxylin and eosin stains over time in a standard sample. This helps ensure consistent staining over time, and can show when reagents must be refreshed. 
ScanningQC checks for poor-quality regions in a scanned slide due to tissue folds, dust, or out-of-focus regions. This is a quick way of  finding "bad" samples that must be re-imaged before analysis.
